About me
------
I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student at CS Department at UW-Madison starting from Fall 2021, advised by [Prof. Xiangyao Yu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yxy/). My research focuses in general query optimization techniques for data warehouses and cloud-native databases.

I obtained M.S. in 2021 from UC San Diego, during which I worked with [Prof. Alin Deutsch](http://db.ucsd.edu/People/alin/) on Polystore systems. I got B.E. from Zhejiang University in 2019.
